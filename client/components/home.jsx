          <h3>About Me</h3>
          <p>Full name is Kenneth Capistrano Cruz, born in the Philippines but raised in New Zealand often find myself talk more English than my native language. Though I am often curious about things I’m no knowledge of and would attempt to learn it in full details.</p>

          <p>I enjoy delivering new ideas to the table and being able to create them from scratch.
             Ideas that would revolutionize the industry or society, in general, are something
             I'm quite interesting to be a part of. I'm told that I'm being creative and smart, I'm passionate about designing and was painting arts and crafts when I was young.
             Now taking a step further, the to design Tech application.

          Designing my own website portfolio, consist basically of my skills set and experience
          about myself that will involve projects that I have to create or partake in. In the
           future date, it will have a blog functionality that will post updates about myself
           currently. Been also delving into micro-computers learning C# in curiosity, to know
           more about software engineering.
          </p>

          Hatching unique ideas is my specialty, often would give concepts people haven't talked
          about or yet to be popular. My ideas also bring smiles and laughter to my fellow workers
          as I've been told. Though Ideas are just concepts and not productive, often during my
          learning, I’ve been told that I’ve asked several questions to ensure that my understanding
          is in detail.
