          <h3>About Me</h3>
          <p>Full name is Kenneth Capistrano Cruz, born in the Philippines but raised in New Zealand often find myself talk more English than my native language. Though I am often curious about things Iâ€™m no knowledge of and would attempt to learn it in full details.</p>

          <p>I enjoy delivering new ideas to the table and being able to create them from scratch.
             Ideas that would revolutionize the industry or society, in general, are something.
             I'm pretty interested in being a part of it. I'm creative and intelligent. I'm passionate about designing and was painting arts and crafts when I was young.
             Now taking a step further, the to design Tech application.

          <p>
          Designing my website portfolio consists of my skills set and
          experience about myself that will involve projects that I have to
          create or partake in. In the future date, it will have a blog functionality
           that will post updates about myself currently. Been also delving into micro-computers learning C# in curiosity, to know
           more about software engineering.

          Hatching unique ideas is my specialty; I often would give concepts people
          haven't talked about or be famous for. My ideas also bring smiles and laughter
           to my fellow workers, as I've been told. Though Ideas are just concepts and not
           productive, often during my
          learning,  I've asked several questions to ensure that my understanding
          is in detail
